# Bedtime Story Teller Example

## Description
This example demonstrates how to build a bedtime story teller application using Arduino UNO Q. 
The application shows how to use a cloud-based large language model (LLM) to generate a bedtime story based on user input.

## Bricks Used

The code detector example uses the following bricks:

- `cloud_llm`: brick to interact with a cloud-based large language model (LLM) for generating story content.
- `web_ui`: brick to create a web interface to get user input and display the generated story.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware

- Arduino UNO Q (x1)
- USB camera (x1)
- USB-C® to USB-A Cable (x1)
- Personal computer with internet access

### Software

- Apps Lab IDE

Note: You can run this example using your Arduino UNO Q as a Single Board Computer (SBC) using a [USB-C hub](https://store.arduino.cc/products/usb-c-to-hdmi-multiport-adapter-with-ethernet-and-usb-hub) with a mouse, keyboard and display attached.
